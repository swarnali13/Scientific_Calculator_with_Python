# Scientific_Calculator_with_Python
This is a scientific calculator made by using python. It can perform:

-Basic arithmetic calculations:

  -Addition
  
  -Subtraction
  
  -Division
  
  -Multiplication
  
-Scientific calculations:

  -computing square root
  
  -logarithm 
  
  -unit conversion(binary to decimal and vice versa).
# Descrption
It is an online scientifc calculator which performs calculations along with mathematical calculations. It's useful for calculation of numbers with very large values. Here the selective iterating statements work similar to switch case in Java(i.e performs a spectific option w.r.t. to given case)
It uses various python functionalities such as:

-Math module

-Aliasing and Importing

-In-built functions such as round(),conditional statements,Loops,print() function and many more.
# Scope and Advantages 
-For the sake of simplicity there is limited scientific calulation tool availability. More scientific calculating tools such as integration,differentiation,trignometric tools etc can also be included to increase the scope of the calculator.

-It is good at dealing with exceptions such as: 

  -DivisionByZero Error
  
  -DomainError 
  
  -RangeError
  
  -TypeError
  
  -User friendly 
# Limitations
-Cannot add or multiply more than two numbers at once.

-Limited scientifc tools availiability.

-Limited unit conversion tools availability.

-Unable to deal with certain exceptions such as TypeError.
# Prequsites
-Must have a Python IDLE to run this program 

-Must have a PC with atleast 4GB RAM
# Exceptions description
Here we are descrbing each type of execeptions(an unexpected situation which is not under our control) which might arsise in this program:

I)DivsionByZeroError: Raised when divsior is 0.

II)DomainError:Raised when the a negative number is provided in the argument of the logarithm function or providing a negative value for square root calculation.

III)RangeError: Raised when number provided is 0 in arg of logarithm function.

IV)TypeError: When user provides an inappropriate data type where implicit conversation is not possible. E.g providing string as an input for int/float data type.
# How to use the program?
1)Run the program on your python IDLE

2)Give your preference as a,b,c,d,e,f or g based on the type of operations you want to perform

3)Provide required inputs for your computation

4)Get the desired output

5)If you want to quit anytime, enter 'quit'. 

6)A thank you message will be displayed after you have quit the program.

7)In case an undesireable output arrises, run the code again and provide the necessary inputs.

8)If you give a preference out of the mentioned one, you'll get a warning message. Same applies for unit conversions and improper outputs.
